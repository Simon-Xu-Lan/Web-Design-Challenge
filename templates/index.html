                The purpose of this project was to analyze how weather changes
                as you get closer to the equator. To accomplish this analysis,
                we first pulled data from the OpenWeatherMap APO to assemble a
                dataset on over 500 cites.
              </p>
              <p class="lead text-black-50 large">
                After assembling the dataset, we used Matplotlib to plot various
                aspects of the weather vs. latitude. Factors we looked at
                includedL temperature, cloudiness, wind speed, and huminity.
                This site provides the source data and visualiztions created as
                part fo the analysis, as well as explanations and decriptions
                aof any trends and correlations witnessed.
